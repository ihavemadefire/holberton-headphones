# Implement a design from scratch

In this project, I implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.

This project presents a unique challenge in that I must copy from a set of designs and build from there, rather than build from a set of instructions.
